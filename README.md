## Editing

ℹ️ Most editors only need this section!

To submit changes to the site,

1. [Fork this repository][forking-repos] to make your own copy.
2. Edit content in `.md` text files and `git commit` + `git push`.
3. [Submit a pull request][pull-requests] to get your work published on the real site!

This site is written in [Markdown][md-syntax], the same formatting used on GitHub, Reddit, Discord, etc. You can easily edit directly on GitHub or with a text editor such as [Visual Studio Code][vs-code].

Some [advanced MkDocs features][mkdocs-features] may not preview correctly on GitHub or in VS Code -- see the [Development](#development) section for fully-rendered local previews.

### Tips

- [Reference-style links][reference-links] are recommended to move URLs elsewhere in the file, which makes it easier to read + edit raw content, reuse links in multiple locations, and update links in one spot.
- [`src/snippets/common-links.md`][common-links] defines a list of common links included in all pages. If something should be linked across many pages, or if a definition seems "missing" from a file, check `common-links.md`. You may need to restart Docker to pick up links added here.

## Deployment

ℹ️ Only site administrators need this section.

This site is deployed to [GitHub Pages][github-pages] as an "organization site" (versus user or project site).

### Configuring GitHub Pages

_Main article: [Getting Started with GitHub Pages][gh-pages-start]_

1.  On the GitHub repo page, go to `Settings > Pages`.
2.  Under Source, set `Branch: gh-pages` and `Folder: / (root)`, then click `Save`.
3.  Wait for site to fully publish to the URL at the top of the page.

### Customizing the Domain Name

_Main article: [Configuring Custom Domains][gh-pages-domain]_

1.  On the GitHub repo page, go to `Settings > Pages`.
2.  Set `Custom Domain: llamamagic.net`, then click `Save`.
3.  `git pull` the `CNAME` file created by GitHub into `src/docs/`.
4.  At your domain name provider, configure DNS records:
    - Create `CNAME` record for `www` as `llamamagic.github.io`
    - Create `A` and `AAAA` records for `@` as GitHub Pages' [IPv4 and IPv6 addresses][gh-pages-addresses].

### Publishing Changes

_Main article: [Publishing Your Site][gh-pages-publish]_

Automatic builds + publishing are triggered by pushing commits to `master` branch.

Changes should appear on the site after a few minutes. Check the [Actions tab][build-status] for build status and error logs.

⚠️ All MkDocs plugins added to the [`Dockerfile`][dockerfile] must also be added to [`Publish.yml`][publish-yml] or the automated build will fail.
