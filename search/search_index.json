You can usually farm these reliably as long as you do them unrestricted.</li> <li>\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 - Two star profiles are good enough to be used unrestricted, but likely have no custom programming for boss mechanics. As long as you're max level though you should be able to farm them relatively well.</li> <li>\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 - One star profiles are profiles that work... sometimes. They've got glaring issues that I either can't, or haven't fixed and are usually only used when you really don't want to do the duty yourself but don't mind dying a million times. While these can sometimes be completed by other jobs, tanks will typically have the best survivability on these profiles simply because of their survivability.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"plugins/pandafarmer/#settings","title":"Settings","text":"<p>There's now a Settings button on the Dungeon Farming tab.

The plugin will run <code>Keeper of the Lake</code> with a Duty Support squad to get Tomes. It's a level 50 dungeon and can be done on any class.</li> <li><code>GC Farm Class</code> - At various points in the relic quest you will need to farm Greater Company Seals. The plugin will run <code>The Sirensong Sea</code> uncapped to get gear to turn in at your grand company for seals. It's a level 50 dungeon and can be done on any class.</li> <li><code>GC Turn In</code> Zodiac Weapons uses RedWine's Platypus botbase to handle Expert Turn In at the grandcompany. It has many inventory and quality of life features and I highly recommend it and configuring it. The button in Zodiac Weapon's settings will install Platypus for you if you don't already have it. Clicking on the Platypus icon will load it's settings for quick access. </li> <li><code>Remain in Barrack while farming</code> - This will have your character go to your Grand Company's Barrack chamber between dungeon runs.</li> <li><code>Light Farm Dungeon</code> This is the dungeon that you will run for light during the Nexus stage of the relic. I personally prefer Ifrit normal, but there are options for other dungeons here.</li> <li><code>Infuse Sphere Scroll</code> During the Novus stage of the relic you will need to infuse your sphere scroll with materia in order to further enhance your relic. You can read about that process here. This button will take any available materia in your inventory and attach it to the scroll. It's used to make the process much quicker than doing it by hand.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"plugins/zodiacweapons/#required-items","title":"Required Items","text":"<p>This tab shows you the items that you are required to get manually that the bot cannot get for you.

This item needs to be infused with two specific materia that's different for each class. This tab will show you what you need for the class you've selected in the Relic Class drop down.</li> <li>For the <code>Zodiac Braves</code> stage of the quest you need 8 items (you can read about them here). These items are crafted, but their materials are rare and Lisbeth can't gather them automatically. They can be purchased off the Market Board for relatively cheap.

It requires you to use the <code>/beckon</code> command to escort an NPC back to home base. This will need to be done manually. It's only required to be done once per weapon.</li> <li>During the <code>Novus</code> stage of the relic you will need to infuse your sphere scroll with materia in order to further enhance your relic. You can read about that process here. This is done to let you customize the stats on your relic weapon, but as these are strictly used for glamour now stats really don't matter. It's best to just get the cheapest materia you can find to get through this stage. Once you've infused the scroll completely, press the start button on the Zodiac Weapons plugin and it'll take it from there.</li> <li>During the <code>Zodiac Braves</code> step of the quest you will be required to do two dungeons manually. <ul> <li><code>Hullbreaker Isle</code> - ~~ The final boss arena is broken up into multiple small rocks that you have to jump between to attack the boss. RB cannot do this. There's a profile in the Profiles folder of this plugin that will do the dungeon up to the final boss and pause there for you to complete it. ~~ We were able to add the final boss arena into the navigation mesh. It should successfully complete the final boss now. But keep an eye on it.</li> <li><code>Stone Vigil (Hard)</code> - This dungeon is troublesome because of the second boss <code>Cuca Fera</code> the giant turtle. The encounter requires you to use the cannons near by to damage him. You also have to kill him before his unstoppable AOE damage kills all the NPCs nearby, as their death will immediately fail the encounter. This encounter is near impossible to do solo on most classes. The only class that can really solo it successfully is Blue Mage. If you have BLU with something like Level 5 Death, you should be able to one shot him. Otherwise, queue this dungeon in a normal group to complete it. It only has to be done once per weapon. </li> </ul> </li> <li>During the <code>Zodiac Braves</code> stage of the quest there are several dungeons that need to be ran, all of which can be done without being on your Relic job or having your relic equipped. Because of this the plugin will attempt to change you to your GC Farm Class selection before queuing for those dungeons.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"plugins/zodiacweapons/#known-issues","title":"Known Issues","text":"<ul> <li>When farming FATEs for the Atma stage of the quest sometimes the bot will get stuck trying to take off between FATEs. Stopping/starting the bot will typically resolve it but you are going to want to monitor the bot during this stage. I have put a check box on the main screen to turn off using Lisbeth to travel during this phase. Uncheck it to use RB's built in Flightor. It's iffy, but may be better than Lisbeth</li> </ul>"},{"location":"purchase/DW/purchase/","title":"Plugins","text":""},{"location":"purchase/DW/purchase/#plugins","title":"Plugins","text":""},{"location":"purchase/DW/purchase/#purchase","title":"Purchase","text":"<p>Here you can find links to purchase the various products available from LlamaMagic.</p>"},{"location":"purchase/DW/purchase/#plugins_1","title":"Plugins","text":""},{"location":"purchase/nt153133/purchase/","title":"BotBases","text":""},{"location":"purchase/nt153133/purchase/#botbases","title":"BotBases","text":""},{"location":"purchase/nt153133/purchase/#purchase","title":"Purchase","text":"<p>Here you can find links to purchase the various products available from LlamaMagic.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"purchase/nt153133/purchasecn/","title":"BotBases","text":""},{"location":"purchase/nt153133/purchasecn/#botbases","title":"BotBases","text":""},{"location":"purchase/nt153133/purchasecn/#purchase","title":"Purchase","text":"<p>Here you can find links to purchase the various products available from LlamaMagic.</p> <p>For Chinese region ONLY</p> <p> </p>"}]}
