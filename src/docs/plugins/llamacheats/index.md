# Llama Cheats

New small plugin called LlamaCheats for those of you who like to be extra cheaty.

"But aren't these things possibly bannable?" You ask. 

Yes of course, any botting/manipulation of the client is. Rule of common sense applies, don't teleport in front of normal players and maybe don't spam 100 instances of Porta in a day. I've used the teleporting a lot fwiw but as always use at your own risk yada yada.

This plugin updates on restart of RebornBuddy and doesn't need to be added to updateBuddy.

## Requirements

- [RebornBuddy][7] with active license (paid)
- [LlamaLibrary][10] (free)

## Purchasing

You can request a 72 hour trial of any of my plugins by joining our [![Discord][3]][4] and typing `/trial` on the #bot-spam channel.

You can purchase it using this button:
??? tip "Purchase"
    [Purchases](http://localhost:8000/purchase/nt153133/purchase/)


## Installation

1. Download the latest version by following the link [here](https://llamacheats.llamaserver.com/LlamaCheats.zip).
2. On the `.zip` file, right click > `Properties` > `Unblock` > `Apply`.

### Cutscenes 
With this option and the plugin enabled the client will no long show any cutscenes. There will be none to skip which includes unskippable ones in duties like Porta.

*There are options to only apply the patch while in duties as well as to disable it when you're in a party with real players (not trust/duty support)*

### Camera
Llama cheats now has camera hacks for noclip, min/max zoom as well as the housing patch to remove most object placing restrictions including wall mounted ones. It also can manually adjust X/Y/Z.

### Housing
This will let you place items anywhere in the house

### Trade
#### Receive
A simple button to receive trades (stops when you're out of space or you press stop or leave that settings tab)

#### Trade a lisbeth order
This is for simplifying crafting gear for another character. Craft your gear, save the json, load the json by pressing the button and it will trade those items to your target

#### Trade Gil
Self-explanatory, trades gil to your target in increments of 1 mil or less until it traded all that you entered.

You cannot run this while running botbase and if you change tabs or close the settings window it will stop for safety. Also you must be next to your target, it's a plugin it can't move. Unless I have it teleportðŸ¤”

Also this uses my patented (patent pending) trading code which does not rely on spamming yes to receive trades. It knows your trade status and the other person's trade status (window open, waiting for accept, accept sent etc).  Also it should work at peak speeds even with high ping. 


### Other Cheats
??? Knockback
    Added knockback prevention to LlamaCheats. When enabled it patches a client function which nullifies any knockback.
