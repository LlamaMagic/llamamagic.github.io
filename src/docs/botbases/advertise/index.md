# Advertise

## Advertise
RP venue advertising botbase does world hopping /shout ads in the 3 major towns along with keeping a party finder up and the option to do in venue announcements 

**For NA/EU/JP/SA only. Not China or Korea**

You can choose to enable world hopping /shout ads, party finder ads, and/or in venue announcements.

All options work on the idea of *before* and *during* time. Before is before the venue open time and during is from open until open + length.
Each option has spots to put pf/shout/announcements that will be used during those set times. These will be shuffled and repeated.

## Party Finder
Keep a party finder constantly up for the duration of the venue open time as well as before open if that option is selected.

## Town Shout Ads 
Teleports to the major 3 cities doing /shout ads at each once and if the option is selected it will travel to all the worlds in your datacenter and do the same.

## In Venue Announcements
If you start the botbases within a house then it can do barker like announcements every X minutes in shout/yell/say chat. If this is enabled with town shout ads you must also use the option to go back to starting location after ads in order to have the bot return your character to the house.


## Key Notes

If using the `Back to starting location after ads` option while in a house make sure that there is a direct path to where you are standing. RB can navigate through a house but it does not see player placed furniture so don't start it behind a desk unless you want to watch it try and jump over the desk.

You can create multiple different profiles and switch between them at the bottom. 

If you hover over the settings they have tooltips.

You can't switch profiles while the botbase is running.

Test Mode will still create party finders and move to the cities/worlds for shouts but it won't actually /shout it will print the message in the RB window as well as in /echo in FFXIV. Test Mode WILL still do in venue announcements, if you want to test them then change their chat channel to echo.

Make note of the before/during for pfs/shouts. It will switch between them past the open time. It won't run the shouts/pf for that time if they are empty. You can import/export them at the bottom. To delete one click the little grey box to the left of the enable field and hit the delete key.
