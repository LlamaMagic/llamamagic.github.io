# Company Workshop

Company Workshop is a new botbase which will automate the redeployment and repair of your Free Company's airships and submersibles. It also automates crafting of airship/sub parts in the FC workshop.

## Limitations

- Only resends ships on the same expedition they have finished
- Current cannot handle if all of a ship's parts break at the same time. The issue is that the parts whose condition is 0% or 100% both come back as 100%. So don't get cheap on repair materials, you want your ships to repair before they hit 0% and there won't be an issue so set the threshold on like 30% or heck even 50%.
- Full automated crafting on Housing items that require multiple stages like the Full Estate Exterior is not supported currently. It should be able to finish the current stage for you but more testing will need to be done if there's reasonable interest in it.
